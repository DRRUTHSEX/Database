## Project Overview

This repository contains both the source code and a growing database of publicly traded companies. The database includes information on transfer agents, investor relations, company shares, and DRS (Direct Registration System) shares. DRS is the only way to register shares in your name and secure property rights over them.


## How to Contribute

You might contribute here by:
- Adding or updating information in the database (e.g., company details, transfer agent data, DRS information).
- Submitting enhancements, bug fixes, or new features for the source code.
- Improving documentation and guides.
