# The WhyDRS Database

## A Public Database for Companies, Brokers, and Transfer Agents

Although information regarding the Direct Registration System and individual publicly traded stock is all available, it is scattered and can be hard to search.

This information has been gathered in one place to make it easy for any investor to get direct access to static information about their investments. [This Lemmy post](https://lemmy.whynotdrs.org/post/21495) goes into detail about the Database structure, goals, and development in addition to information on contributing.

You can view the raw data, volunteer missing information to be added to the database, or search for the entity you are interested in below. All data available is free for use and access.
