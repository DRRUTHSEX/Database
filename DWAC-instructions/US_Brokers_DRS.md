Transfer Agent Instructions:
The transfer will take 5-10 business days to process once received by the transfers team. If you're feeling uncertain you can check in with ${name of broker} by contacting them through the following methods: ${broker phone number}, ${broker email address}, ${broker contact page}.


{if transfer agent is Computershare}
If you don't have an existing ${transfer agent name} account:
Your broker and ${transfer agent name} will take care of the transfer and ${transfer agent name} will open an account for you. This will take another 2-3 business days.

If you have an existing ${transfer agent name} account:
Your broker will DRS transfer the shares based on your name and address. As a result, a second account may be created for you. This can be for a few reasons, such as a middle initial existing on one account, but not the other. If your name and address match exactly, then the transfer will process within the normal amount of time. If not, then it will take another 2-4 weeks for the account to be made and the DRS Account Statement sent out to you.

Your broker may ask you for a ${transfer agent name} account number. For security reasons we do not recommend giving this information to your broker. With ${transfer agent name} accounts, the account number is the "key" that allows brokers to authorize a transfer of shares out of the DRS and back to the broker.


After your shares leave your broker:
You can wait 3-5 business days for your account statement to arrive in the mail, or you can begin your account creation early by using your SSN. Although if your name and address are entered differently to your broker it may open a second account. To open your account with your SSN:
Go to Computershare.com/us.
Click on “Login to Investor Center”.
Click on “Register Now”.
Answer security questions such as Social Security number, ZIP Code, name of the stock that you hold (${company name}).
${transfer agent name} will then prompt you to create your username, password and security questions.
Once your account is created, ${transfer agent name} will send you a verification letter in the mail.
You can wait 3-5 business days for the verification letter, or you might be able to verify your identity immediately online.


To verify online, ${transfer agent name} will ask some security questions based on info they take from LexisNexis. Please note, part of the process is to give a question with zero correct answers. So read the questions carefully.


If you have any issues, you can call ${transfer agent name} on the phone. ${transfer agent name}'s contact information for each company can be found here: https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#Contact/Enquiry 
Scroll down to “Contact information for a specific company” and search for ${company name} or ${Stock Symbol} to find their phone number.
If you don't hear any relevant options with the automated menu, you can keep pressing 0 to get through to a human.




When you receive the verification code letter:
Return to Computershare.com/us.
Click on “Login to Investor Center”.
Login using the username, and password you have created.
Then you can enter the verification code.
You now have full access to your ${transfer agent name} account.
There is no more need for the verification code.
We recommend you now activate your two-step verification (2FA) to improve your account security. You can set this up by going to: "My Profile", then "Account Security Preferences".}
