# If broker can DRS transfer, but is outside the US:

## Intro/disclaimer:
{if a transfer agent account number is required}
${name of broker} requires you have an existing ${transfer agent name} account before they will directly register your shares.


Therefore, they will ask you for a ${transfer agent name} account number. For security reasons it is not recommended to give this information to your broker, but in this case there may not be another choice. With ${transfer agent name} accounts, the account number is the "key" that allows brokers to authorize a transfer of shares out of the DRS and back to the broker.


If you provide your account number to initiate the transfer, it is recommended to protect your ${transfer agent name} account by making a small change to your name or address to block any unauthorized attempts at withdrawing your directly registered shares. Such as adding or removing a middle initial, or making a subtle enough change to your address that you can still receive your snail mail (add or remove a borough, or a space in your postal/zip code).


Only do this when you are confident you are finished transferring your shares from your broker to the Direct Registration System, and if you are confident you do not want to move your shares back to your broker.


If you don't have a ${transfer agent name} account:
The only way to open one as a non-US citizen is to transfer shares to them, which is possible with IBKR (see our guide for directly registering from IBKR here), or to use GiveAShare.com.}

{if an IBKR Reseller}
${name of broker} is an Interactive Brokers (IBKR) reseller. No need to contact customer service, as everything can be done through the IBKR client. You can follow the IBKR guide instead.}

{if broker uses Drivewealth}
DISCLAIMER: Initiating any kind of transfer (DRS, ACAT, DTC, FOP, etc.) will temporarily freeze your ${name of broker} account until all of the shares are settled with the receiving broker or transfer agent. You will not have access to trading during this time, even if there is an active position in your account. Access to funds and trading will resume when the transfer is complete.


{If a fee is charged}
${name of broker} charges a ${expected fee} fee to DRS transfer. This means each time you want to DRS transfer a specific stock (no matter how many shares) you are charged ${expected fee}. You will need to make sure you have ${expected fee} settled in your account before you can transfer.}

{If free to transfer}
${name of broker} can DRS transfer for free.}

{If no info on fees available}
${name of broker} may charge a fee for each DRS Transfer. This means each time you want to DRS transfer a specific stock (no matter how many shares) you are charged a fee.}

Start a web chat with them on their website, or through their app.
Ask for the contact email of the stock transfers team to initiate an outbound DRS transfer.
The agent will let you know the email address, and either ask you to call them instead, or handle the transfer request for you right there and then.
If you get the email address, for the subject line write: “Outbound DRS Transfer Request (Bank of Scotland account number)”.


Be sure to include:
Say: “I want an outbound DRS transfer of my ${Stock Symbol} shares to ${transfer agent name}”.
If there are transfer fees, put a statement agreeing to the fees (eg. I agree to the fee of ${expected fee} associated with the DRS transfer).

You will need to provide the following information to the support agent:
Full name.

Phone number.
Home address (house number, street name, city, region, postcode).
You can give them your ${transfer agent name} account number, or ask them to open a new account as part of the process. (For security reasons we do not recommend giving your ${transfer agent name} account number to your broker.

The support agent will then submit the transfer request with Citi (BCEE's US broker).


BMO Investorline

Ask the support agent about the "updated standards document" if you wish to see your eligibility.


It's also a $150 fee to transfer to another broker. If you're already in ${name of broker} then your cheapest option (without selling and repurchasing) is to DRS transfer.

IBKR
DISCLAIMER: If you deposit money into ${name of broker} using a “Direct ACH Transfer”, then ${name of broker} may hold on to any purchased shares for up to 44 days before you can direct register them. If you do a “Bank Wire” transfer there is a small fee, but you can direct register your shares 3 days after purchase.


How to get the $5 for the DRS transfer fee:
When your money arrives with ${name of broker} it will be in your local currency. To convert it to US Dollars you need to:
Click on “Trade” on the menu bar and select “Convert Currency”.
A pop up will ask you what currency you want converted (your local currency), and what currency you want to convert to (USD).
Once you have filled out the boxes click on submit and your money will have converted instantly.
You now need to wait 3 days for the USD to settle before you can transfer. You can purchase more shares with the USD immediately, but for transfers you have to wait for the cash to settle.


If you transferred shares into IBKR, check your cost basis:
Often shares transferred to ${name of broker} are missing their cost basis. It is worth double checking that your cost basis is recorded properly before you start your transfer from ${name of broker}. (Please note: ${name of broker} has a column called cost basis on your portfolio page. If you have transferred your shares to ${name of broker}, please ignore this cost basis, as it is not the actual cost basis of your shares).
You can find your cost basis by looking at your account statements, activity statements, or contract notes from the broker you purchased the shares with.
To update your cost basis in ${name of broker} click on “Performance & Reports” from the top menu and select “Tax Documents”.
At the bottom of the page you will find the “Cost Basis” Section.
Click on the cog-wheel icon next to “Position Transfer”.
On the next page select the transfer from the drop down menu (labeled by the date of the transfer).
A table will appear with the quantity of shares you transferred.
To fill it out, you need to click on the “Add Lot” button.
Here you can break down the batch of shares into the batches you ordered them in. (For example, 10 shares might have been bought in 2 lots of 5).
If you are unsure about which shares you transferred, all share transfers are marked as First In, First Out by default. This means the oldest shares transfer first.
To fill out each lot you will provide the quantity of shares you purchased, the date you purchased those shares, and the total cost of those shares (be sure to remove any trading fees you paid).
Once you have added enough lots to make up for the total amount of shares, you can click on “Continue” to submit the cost basis.
Please note, even at this stage ${transfer agent name} may not receive your cost basis. Your best bet is to keep a hold of your records showing your cost basis. It will make things a lot smoother when it comes to tax return time.​


How to Transfer:
Optional: You can select if you'd like your shares transferred as “First In, First Out” (oldest shares transfer first) or “Last In First Out”(newest shares transfer first). To do this:
Click on “Performance & Reports” from the top menu, and select “Tax Documents”.
Underneath “Tax Optimizer” you will find an “Account Match Method” drop down list.
First In, First Out is selected as default (oldest shares transfer first), but you can switch to Last in, First Out (newest shares transfer first).
There are several other options, but these are the main two to concern yourself with.
Click on “Transfer & Pay” from the top menu and select “Transfer Positions”.
On the next page select “Outgoing”.
On the next page select “United States” from the drop down menu.
On the next page select the option “Deliver Shares to the Issuer's Transfer Agent/Registrar”.
${name of broker} have now streamlined the next part. You should not have to enter the Transfer Agent's info as there is only one Transfer Agent for ${company name} and that's ${transfer agent name}.
You are shown the name the shares will be direct registered in (same as your ${name of broker} account name). This, along with your address is the only info needed to set up your account with ${transfer agent name}. The rest you provide once it's opened.
You can leave the Tax Identification Number alone (you will give this to ${transfer agent name} later).
Select which stock you'd like to transfer (${company name}) and how many shares you'd like to transfer.
Click “Continue”.
On the next page you'll see a summary of the transfer and ${name of broker} asks you to sign your name (simply type your name to match what it says on the screen).
You will then be asked to provide your login details again as authorization. If you have 2FA activated then you will need to authorize through that as well.
Once you have done that and clicked “Submit” ${name of broker} will review your transfer request. This takes about a day.​​


After you have submitted the transfer request:
${name of broker} will not contact you when the status of your transfer updates, even if it fails.
To check in on your transfer you can login, click on “Transfer & Pay” from the top menu, and select “Transaction Status & History”.

This can be for a few reasons, such as a middle initial existing on one account, but not the other. If your name and address match exactly, then the transfer will process within the normal amount of time. If not, then it will take another 2-4 weeks for the account to be made and the DRS Account Statement sent out to you.

Your broker may ask you for a ${transfer agent name} account number. For security reasons we do not recommend giving this information to your broker.
